## **Description**
ViralCutter is an innovative tool for generating viral videos from existing content. With advanced video and audio processing techniques, ViralCutter cuts and edits video segments that are perfect for sharing on social media. Using the WhisperX model for transcription and automatic subtitle generation, it adapts videos to a 9:16 (vertical) format, ideal for platforms like TikTok and Instagram Reels, as well as YouTube Shorts.

## **Features**

- **Video Download**: Downloads videos from YouTube using a provided URL.
- **Audio Transcription**: Converts audio to text using the WhisperX model.
- **Viral Segment Identification**: Uses AI to detect parts of the video with high viral potential.
- **Cutting and Format Adjustment**: Cuts selected segments and adjusts the aspect ratio to 9:16.
- **Audio and Video Merging**: Combines transcribed audio with processed video clips.
- **Batch Export**: Generates a ZIP file with all created viral videos, making it easy to download and share.
- **Custom Subtitles**: Create personalized subtitles with options for color, highlighting, or word-by-word display, allowing for extensive editing possibilities.

- I created this site to help split the transcription, since ChatGPT has limits: [Split text for ChatGPT](https://rafaelgodoyebert.github.io/ViralCutter/)

## **Limitations**

- Processing time may be high for long videos.
- The quality of generated videos may vary based on the quality of the original video.
